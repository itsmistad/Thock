# Thock

Thock is a combination of a popular Minecraft modding framework, Fabric, and one of the most performant (if not *the* most performant) Spigot forks, Paper.

##### Why "Thock"?

> **thock** [ thock ]
>
> *noun*
>
> A clear, echoing thud, as of [a mechanical key switch on a keyboard.]
>
> — (100%, totally) Wiktionary

The commonly coined term for the sound of a mechanical key switch bottoming-out felt befitting-but-also-not-so-befitting because I'm obsessed with mechanical keyboards and their assembly processes. Thock is a passion project rooted in both my appreciation for the brilliance of Paper and the greatness of Fabric and my disappointment in their incompatibility with one another.

##### What does it do?

Right now? Nothing!

— but it is in active development, and the goals of the project are as follows:

- [ ] 99.9% compatibility with Fabric mods
- [ ] 99.9% compatibility with Paper/Spigot/Bukkit plugins
- [ ] Yarn package management support
- [ ] Standardized configuration format and management for Thock packages
- [ ] Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript support for packages
- [ ] Bedrock & Java cross-edition support
